    "Many machine learning algorithms attempt to find trends in the data by comparing features of data points. However, there is an issue when the features are on drastically different scales.The goal of normalization is to make every datapoint have the same scale so each feature is equally important.But when we use normalization, there is no significant change in the data.Because normalization works when the difference between features is high. For example, if we use KNN for the relationship between the houses sold between 2000-2020 and the values. of the houses, we would have to normalize. Because years are 4 digits, but the value of the house is maybe millions. Our data already varies between -3 and 3. the difference is very little. Min-Max normalization did not cause significant changes in the data. "
